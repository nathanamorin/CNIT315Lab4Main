# CNIT315 Lab4 9:30 Lab

### Project Created for Purdue University CNIT 315 9:30 Lab.

### Instructions for testing / running program

1)Testing
  
  a)Compile lab4_lib.c & lab4_testing.c with [gcc -o tester.out lab4_lib.c lab4_testing.c]
  
  b)Run tester.out [output file]
  
  c)Result of test is writen out to the specified output file
  
2) Main Function
  
  a) Compile lab4_lib.c & lab4_main.c with [gcc -o lab4Main.out lab4_lib.c lab4_main.c]
  
  b) Run lab4Main.c, following directions for inputing & manipulating strings / chars.
  
  c) Enter -1 in menu to exit program



### Objectives
* Test functions handling arrays and strings
* Provide useful feedback on tested functions
* Generate human readable report by exporting to text file


### Contents

* lab4_lib.c - contains functions from the coding group
* lab4_lib.h - contains function prototypes
* lab4_testing.c - contains testing functions from testing group
* lab4_testing.h - contains function prototypes for testing group along with testing assumptions
* lab4_main.c - contains main function that calls lib functions with terminal menu interface
* ascii_art - contents of this file will be printed out when main function runs
* console.c/h - contains helper functions for interacting with terminal console
